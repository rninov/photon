%description
zchunk is a compressed file format that splits the file into independent
chunks.  This allows you to only download the differences when downloading a
new version of the file, and also makes zchunk files efficient over rsync.
zchunk files are protected with strong checksums to verify that the file you
downloaded is in fact the file you wanted.
